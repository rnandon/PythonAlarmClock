# PythonAlarmClock
Alarm clock app built in python

Uses the time library to set a current time. Later modifications could include asking the user for an alarm time and using that in place of a default value of one minute after the current time and using a while loop instead of a limited for loop to set the time while the alarm has not been triggered.

Another modification would be only displaying current time when a new time is set. In its current state, the program outputs the current time every 5 seconds until the alarm time is reached.
